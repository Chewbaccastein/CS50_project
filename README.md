# CS50_project
Final project for CS50 Python:
**Cuckoo Clark with alarm function**

-Cuckoo Clark sings every hour, matching the hour on the clock (e.g., 1:00 PM = 1 cuckoo, 5:00 PM = 5 cuckoos).

-Uses a 12-hour clock format (AM/PM).

-Quiet hours are from 9:00 PM to 8:00 AM â€” no cuckoo sounds during this time.

-When an alarm is set, Clark will sing until you either Snooze or Stop it.

-If you snooze, Clark will sing again after 9 minutes.


**Usage**
- Live mode: current time based on server-synced time
- Test mode: let's user chage current time in order to test the Cuckoo alarm/hourly sings
